# CreateCP-KS.ps1

## Purpose

This PowerShell script automates the creation of cloud providers and cloud keystores within a Venafi platform. It utilizes GraphQL mutations to interact with the Venafi platform and reads configuration data from a provided CSV file.

## Author

Venafi, Inc.

## Requirements

* PowerShell version 3.0 or later
* Venafi API credentials (TPPLApiKey)

## Dependencies

None

## Usage

1. Update the script with your API URL and API key.
2. Prepare a CSV file with the required configuration data (see CSV format below).
3. Run the script with the following parameters:

   ```powershell
   ./CreateCP-KS.ps1 -ApiUrl "https://api.venafi.cloud/graphql" -TPPLApiKey "your_api_key" -CsvPath "path/to/your/data.csv"
so there would not be mistakes with the API URL
